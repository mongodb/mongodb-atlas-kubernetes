If your `regionConfigs` has only `readOnlySpecs`, `analyticsSpecs`, or both, set this value to `0`. If you have multiple `regionConfigs` objects (your cluster is multi-region or multi-cloud), they must have priorities in descending order. The highest priority is `7`.

                                      **Example:** If you have three regions, their priorities would be `7`, `6`, and `5` respectively. If you added two more regions for supporting electable nodes, the priorities of those regions would be `4` and `3` respectively.

                          This setting configures the ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` to redact any document field contents from a message accompanying a given log event before logging. This prevents the program from writing potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log. Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file names are still visible in the logs.

                          Use ``redactClientLogData`` in conjunction with Encryption at Rest and TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption) to assist compliance with regulatory requirements.

                          *Note*: changing this setting on a cluster will trigger a rolling restart as soon as the cluster is updated.

                          By default, Atlas scales under `WORKLOAD_TYPE`. This mode allows Atlas to scale your analytics nodes in parallel to your operational nodes.

                          When configured as `SEQUENTIAL`, Atlas scales all nodes sequentially. This mode is intended for steady-state workloads and applications performing latency-sensitive secondary reads.

                          When configured as `NODE_TYPE`, Atlas scales your electable nodes in parallel with your read-only and analytics nodes. This mode is intended for large, dynamic workloads requiring frequent and timely cluster tier scaling. This is the fastest scaling strategy, but it might impact latency of workloads when performing extensive secondary reads.

Each `regionConfigs` object describes the region's priority in elections and the number and type of MongoDB nodes that MongoDB Cloud deploys to the region.

                      This setting configures the ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` to redact any document field contents from a message accompanying a given log event before logging. This prevents the program from writing potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log. Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file names are still visible in the logs.

                      Use ``redactClientLogData`` in conjunction with Encryption at Rest and TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption) to assist compliance with regulatory requirements.

                      *Note*: changing this setting on a cluster will trigger a rolling restart as soon as the cluster is updated.

                      By default, Atlas scales under `WORKLOAD_TYPE`. This mode allows Atlas to scale your analytics nodes in parallel to your operational nodes.

                      When configured as `SEQUENTIAL`, Atlas scales all nodes sequentially. This mode is intended for steady-state workloads and applications performing latency-sensitive secondary reads.

                      When configured as `NODE_TYPE`, Atlas scales your electable nodes in parallel with your read-only and analytics nodes. This mode is intended for large, dynamic workloads requiring frequent and timely cluster tier scaling. This is the fastest scaling strategy, but it might impact latency of workloads when performing extensive secondary reads.

Each `regionConfigs` object describes the region's priority in elections and the number and type of MongoDB nodes that MongoDB Cloud deploys to the region. Each `regionConfigs` object must have either an `analyticsSpecs` object, `electableSpecs` object, or `readOnlySpecs` object. Tenant clusters only require `electableSpecs`. Dedicated clusters can specify any of these specifications, but must have at least one `electableSpecs` object within a `replicationSpec`.

                            If you set `replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].analyticsSpecs.instanceSize` : `M30`, set `replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].electableSpecs.instanceSize` : `M30` if you have electable nodes and `replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].readOnlySpecs.instanceSize` : `M30` if you have read-only nodes.
