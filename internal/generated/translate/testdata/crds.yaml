                                        with the peered VPC.

                        This setting configures the ``mongod`` or ``mongos`` to redact any document field contents from a message accompanying a given log event before logging. This prevents the program from writing potentially sensitive data stored on the database to the diagnostic log. Metadata such as error or operation codes, line numbers, and source file names are still visible in the logs.
                        
                        Use ``redactClientLogData`` in conjunction with Encryption at Rest and TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption) to assist compliance with regulatory requirements.
                        
                        *Note*: changing this setting on a cluster will trigger a rolling restart as soon as the cluster is updated.

                        By default, Atlas scales under WORKLOAD_TYPE. This mode allows Atlas to scale your analytics nodes in parallel to your operational nodes.
                        
                        When configured as SEQUENTIAL, Atlas scales all nodes sequentially. This mode is intended for steady-state workloads and applications performing latency-sensitive secondary reads.
                        
                        When configured as NODE_TYPE, Atlas scales your electable nodes in parallel with your read-only and analytics nodes. This mode is intended for large, dynamic workloads requiring frequent and timely cluster tier scaling. This is the fastest scaling strategy, but it might impact latency of workloads when performing extensive secondary reads.

                            **IMPORTANT**: Slack integrations now use the OAuth2 verification method and must  be initially configured, or updated from a legacy integration, through the Atlas  third-party service integrations page. Legacy tokens will soon no longer be  supported.

                            Consider configuring an alternative monitoring integration before June 16th to maintain visibility into your MongoDB deployments.
