## Project overview

MongoDB Atlas Kubernetes Operator — a Kubernetes operator that provides native integration between Kubernetes and MongoDB Atlas. It manages Atlas projects, clusters, database users, network access, backups, and more through Kubernetes custom resources.

## Setup

This project uses [devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox). Before making any changes, verify you are inside a devbox environment:

```shell
if [ -z "$DEVBOX_SHELL_ENABLED" ]; then echo "WARNING: Not in a devbox environment. Run 'devbox shell' first."; fi
```

If not in a devbox environment, always ask the user whether to prefix commands with `devbox run`.

## Code style and conventions

Code style and formatting conventions are maintained as agent skills. See the Skills section below for local and global skill directories.

## Architecture

Key directories:

- `api/v1/` — CRD type definitions (the public API surface). Each `atlas*_types.go` file defines a custom resource (e.g. `AtlasProject`, `AtlasDeployment`, `AtlasDatabaseUser`).
- `internal/controller/` — Reconciliation controllers, one sub-package per custom resource (e.g. `atlasproject/`, `atlasdeployment/`). This is where the core operator logic lives.
- `pkg/` — Importable library code (controller helpers, finalizers, rate limiting, state machine).
- `internal/indexer/` — Hand-written indexer registration logic. Registers field indexes on the controller-runtime cache so controllers can efficiently look up resources by fields like project references or credentials.
- `internal/mocks/` — Generated mock interfaces for Atlas SDK and translation layers.
- `internal/generated/` — Scaffolded code generated by `make gen-all`. Contains three sub-areas:
  - `internal/generated/crds/` — Embedded CRD YAML generated from OpenAPI specs.
  - `internal/generated/indexers/` — Scaffolded field indexers for experimental CRDs (e.g. look up clusters/database users by group).
  - `internal/generated/controller/` — Scaffolded controllers for experimental CRDs.
- `internal/generated/controller/connectionsecret/` — Controller that manages connection secrets for feature generated CRDs. It watches Cluster/FlexCluster resources and reconciles Kubernetes Secrets containing connection strings, credentials, and endpoints so applications can connect to Atlas databases.
- `internal/nextapi/` — Experimental / auto-generated types and controllers (enabled with `EXPERIMENTAL=1`).
- `internal/nextapi/generated/v1/` — Go types generated from OpenAPI specs. Do not edit by hand.
- `config/` — Kustomize overlays, CRD bases (`config/crd/`), RBAC (`config/rbac/`), webhook config, samples.
- `config/generated/` — Generated CRDs from OpenAPI specs. Do not edit by hand.
- `cmd/manager/` — Operator entrypoint.
- `test/` — All non-unit test code (see Testing section below).
- `docs/` — Project documentation (development, testing, releases, runbooks).

## Testing

See @docs/testing.md for the full testing philosophy and mock examples.

Key principles:

- Prefer unit tests over integration and e2e tests. Unit tests are the primary gatekeepers against regressions.
- Prefer TDD: write the test before the implementation when the behavior is clear.
- Keep each test focused on a single check.
- Use external test packages (`package xxx_test`) whenever possible.
- When adding new e2e tests, use the newer `test/e2e2/` framework instead of `test/e2e/`.

Running tests:

- `make unit-test` — run all unit tests with race detection and coverage. This should always pass without any setup.
- `make int-test label=<label>` — run integration tests (requires `AKO_INT_TEST=1` and Atlas credentials).
- `make e2e label=<label>` — run e2e tests (requires `AKO_E2E_TEST=1`, Atlas credentials, and a kind cluster).
- Run a single test: `go test -run TestFoo ./pkg/...`

Test code layout:

- `test/helper/` — shared test helpers and utilities.
- `test/atlas/` — Atlas SDK service mocks for unit tests.
- `test/int/` — integration tests (skipped by default, need `AKO_INT_TEST=1`).
- `test/e2e/` — end-to-end tests (skipped by default, need `AKO_E2E_TEST=1`).

Mocking:

- For Kubernetes: use `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/client/fake` with `NewClientBuilder`.
- For Atlas: mock at the SDK service interface level using structs in `test/atlas/`. Prefer this over HTTP-level mocking.
- Generated mocks live in `internal/mocks/` — regenerate with `make generate`.

## Guardrails

Do not:

- Edit generated files by hand. These are regenerated by `make generate` or `make gen-all`:
  - `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` files anywhere in the tree
  - Files under `internal/nextapi/generated/v1/`
  - Files under `config/generated/`
  - Files under `internal/mocks/`
- Run `go mod tidy`, `go generate`, or any Go toolchain command outside of devbox. Always use `make` targets or prefix with `devbox run`.
- Add new dependencies without running `make lint` and `make unit-test` to verify compatibility.
- Introduce e2e tests when unit or integration tests suffice. E2e tests are expensive and slow CI.

## Verification

After making changes, run `make ci` to execute all unit tests and linting checks before considering the work done. This is the same gate that CI enforces on pull requests.

For smaller iterations, run `make fmt && make lint && make unit-test` individually.

## Skills

Agent skills with detailed instructions are available in these directories:

- `.claude/skills/` — project-specific skills
- `~/.claude/skills/` — user-level skills

Available skills:

- `investigate-e2e-failure` — diagnose CI end-to-end test failures by downloading and analyzing GitHub Actions logs using `gh`.

## Makefile targets

Run `make help` for the full list. Key targets:

- `make run` — build and run the operator locally against kind
- `make manager` — build the manager binary
- `make generate` — generate code (deep copy, mocks)
- `make manifests` — generate CRDs, RBAC, webhooks
- `make fmt` — format code (gci)
- `make vet` — run go vet
- `make lint` — run golangci-lint
- `make unit-test` — run unit tests
- `make e2e label=<label>` — run e2e tests by label
- `make ci` — run all unit tests and linting checks
- `make install-crds` — install CRDs in Kubernetes
- `make run-kind` / `make stop-kind` — manage local kind cluster
- `make image` — build operator image for local development
- `make bundle` — generate OLM bundle
- `make clean` — clean built binaries and generated files
- `make gen-all` — generate all CRDs, Go types, and scaffolding
- `make api-docs` — generate API documentation

## Bundle generation

The operator is distributed on OpenShift via OLM (Operator Lifecycle Manager). `make bundle` generates the OLM bundle — a directory containing the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV), CRDs, and metadata that OLM uses to install and upgrade the operator.

See @docs/dev/bundle.md for full details on the bundle pipeline, directory layout, versioning, and deployment.

Key targets:

- `make bundle` — generate the full OLM bundle (CSV, CRDs, metadata, Dockerfile) into `bundle/`.
- `make bundle-dev` — generate a bundle patched for the QA Atlas endpoint.
- `make bundle-build` — build the bundle container image.
- `make bundle-validate` — validate the bundle with `operator-sdk bundle validate`.
- `make deploy-olm` — build, push, and deploy the bundle to OpenShift via CatalogSource and Subscription.
- `make clean-bundle` — remove all generated bundle and deploy artifacts.

Key files:

- `config/manifests-template/bases/` — hand-maintained CSV template. Edit this to change operator metadata or install modes.
- `config/release/{dev,prod}/` — Kustomize overlays per environment (`ENV` variable, default `dev`).
- `version.json` — source of truth for `current` (released) and `next` (upcoming) versions.
- `bundle/` and `bundle.Dockerfile` — generated output, not checked in.

## Experimental / generated CRDs

Set `EXPERIMENTAL=1` to enable experimental features. This affects `manifests`, `generate`, and `install-crds` targets by including CRDs and types from `internal/nextapi/`.

Key targets for generated/scaffolded CRDs:

- `make gen-crds` — generate CRDs from OpenAPI specs into `config/generated/crd/bases/`
- `make gen-go-types` — generate Go types from generated CRDs into `internal/nextapi/generated/v1/`
- `make run-scaffolder` — generate controller scaffolding and indexers
- `make gen-all` — run all of the above plus formatting
- `make regen-crds` — clean and regenerate CRDs
- `make build-autogen` — generate everything and build an experimental image
