# `mongodb/mongodb-atlas-operator` depends on a series of Custom Resource
# Definitions and they need to exist in the Kubernetes cluster in order for the
# Operator to work. They are provided by the
# `mongodb/mongodb-atlas-operator-crds` Helm chart.
#
# When installing `mongodb/mongodb-atlas-operator`, by default, the `-crds`
# Chart will also be installed. This might not be what you want, specially if
# you are installing the Operator in a constrained environment, where you can't
# create a clusterwide resource, for instance.

# If the `mongodb/mongodb-atlas-operator-crds` is already installed, its
# installation can be disabled by changing this value to `false`.
