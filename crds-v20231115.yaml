If you set this value to `1` and **clusterType** is `SHARDED`, MongoDB Cloud deploys a single-shard sharded cluster. Don't create a sharded cluster with a single shard for production environments. Single-shard sharded clusters don't provide the same benefits as multi-shard configurations.

                                 If you are upgrading a replica set to a sharded cluster, you cannot increase the number of shards in the same update request.  You should wait until after the cluster has completed upgrading to sharded and you have reconnected all application clients to the MongoDB router before adding additional shards. Otherwise, your data might become inconsistent once MongoDB Cloud begins distributing data across shards.

Dedicated** clusters can specify any of these specifications, but must have at least one **electableSpecs** object within a **replicationSpec**. Every hardware specification must use the same **instanceSize**.

                                          - set `"replicationSpecs[n].regionConfigs[m].providerName" : "AWS"`.

                                          The maximum input/output operations per second (IOPS) depend on the selected **.instanceSize** and **.diskSizeGB**.
                                          This parameter defaults to the cluster tier's standard IOPS value.
                                          Changing this value impacts cluster cost.
                                          MongoDB Cloud enforces minimum ratios of storage capacity to system memory for given cluster tiers. This keeps cluster performance consistent with large datasets.

                                          - Instance sizes `M10` to `M40` have a ratio of disk capacity to system memory of 60:1.
                                          - Instance sizes greater than `M40` have a ratio of 120:1.
