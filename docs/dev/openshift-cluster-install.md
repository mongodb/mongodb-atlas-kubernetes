## Openshift cluster installation

Open the link (you need to have an account registered in RedHat and added to "mongoDB" organization):
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned

1. Ensure you have an AWS account configured in `~/.aws/credentials`
1. Download and unpack the MacOS installer
1. Copy the `scripts/openshift/install-config.yaml` to some `<temp_directory>`. Set the following:
   * `pullSecret: '<..>'` (copy the content of the Pull Secrets from the link above)
   * `sshKey: | \n` (public ssh Key)
1. Run `./openshift-install create cluster --dir=<temp_directory>`.
  * `--dir=` points to the directory where the `install-config.yaml` is located
  * the installer will verify permissions and will show the ones that are missing - it's necessary to give them to your AWS account
1. Wait for ~40 minutes

Some notes on configuration of the cluster:
* it's not possible to have less than 3 replicas for control plane and 2 replicas for worker nodes 
  (see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.html?extIdCarryOver=true&intcmp=7013a000002CtetAAC&sc_cid=701f2000001OH7iAAG#installation-configuration-parameters_installing-aws-customizations)
* by default Openshift uses `m5.xlarge` for controlPlane nodes and `m5.large` for worker nodes. `m5.xlarge` uses 16Gb for memory
  and this is the smallest memory allowed for each controlplane instance. In our development we use `t3.xlarge` which provides the same
  memory but costs cheaper.
* removing the existing cluster can be done by calling `./openshift-install destroy cluster` (not sure if this needs the SSH keys)
