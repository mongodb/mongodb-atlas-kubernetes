## Openshift cluster installation

Open the link (you need to have an account registered in RedHat and added to "mongoDB" organization):
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned

1. Ensure you have an AWS account configured in `~/.aws/credentials`
1. Download and unpack the MacOS installer
1. Run `./openshift-install create cluster`. (*TODO this default configuration results in quite a big cluster, this needs 
   to be changed to a smaller values somehow*)
  * choose the zone that has enough VPCs
  * specify the Pull Secrets (can be copied from the link above)
  * the installer will verify permissions and will show the ones that are missing - it's necessary to give them to your AWS account
1. Wait for ~40 minutes

The log of the last installation:
